teaser: When building a design system, style-props are a nice interface into design tokens.  It is easier to understand the interface than defining/importing/using things like scss variables or mixins.  Creating a foundational component with style-props can help centralize the logic/styles.  However, choosing which markup to render for the foundational component at that point is difficult. It is too high-level of a component to make decisions like that.  Often times it leads to div/span soup.  Polymorphic components are a great way to allow consumers a choice for what markup to render, while providing them access to the design thru the style-prop api.
