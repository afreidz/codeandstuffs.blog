  Mostly I thinking about code. Sometimes I think about other stuffs.  Should all of that stay in my brain and never bother someone else's conscious mind? Probably. But I do think it helps me to put those thoughts into words.  Otherwise they are just a jumbled mess, that I inevitably forget, occupying space in a brain that has little to give.  So here goes my attempt to become a blogger ... about code and stuffs

<Section>

I am a [software engineer](https://linkedin.com/in/andyfreidenfelds) by trade. I have been working on large-scale e-commerce sites for over 15 years. I mostly stick to JavaScript despite its many, MANY flaws. There are lots of patterns, anti-patterns, tricks, tips, and oddities that I have come across in the last 15 years. While I am no replacement for [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com), hopefully the things I do manage to jot down here will be of **some** value to **someone**.

The JavaScript ecosystem and community is already full. So if you don't need another source of noise, I don't blame you. I can offer no sales pitch for this blog. I hope it becomes a useful tool for my own catharsis primarily, and a resource for others secondarily.

### What to Expect from the Code

What kinds of things can you expect from this site? Code examples are probably obvious. They will look like this:

<Section invert={true}>

```jsx
// isEvil.test.jsx

import crypto from "totally-not-mining-with-your-machine/crypto";

function iDontEvenLikeReact() {
  const shouldIDoThis = false;
  return <h1>Hello</h1>;
}

describe("my life", () => {
  it("is going", () => {
    expect(crypto.isMining).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

```scss
// somefile.scss

@use "sass:color";

.someclass :global(p) {
  font-weight: 600;
  font-size: 12px;
  font-family: "Helvetica", sans-serif;
  background-image: url("https://placehold.it/1000/1000");
}
```

### What to expect from the stuffs

There is no telling where my stream of consciousness will take me. So be prepared for some really off-topic stuff. I am a recent new father, at the time of this post I have two boys (2yr & 6mo). They are **amazing** and occupy so much of my time and brain. So I may talk about parenting. I am also into Chicago sports so I might play arm-chair GM a few times.

There may be some posts where I talk business, working in an engineering department, or things that I have experienced that have-worked/didn't-work. My only goal is to avoid being political and controversial at all costs! I have also sworn off engaging people on social media so no comment section.

To that end, **welcome!** I hope you stay a while!
